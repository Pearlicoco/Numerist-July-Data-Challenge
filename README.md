# Numerist-July-Data-Challenge
I participated in The Numerist July Data Challenge on Twitter. This analysis was carried out solely on Tableau and here is the summary of my findings.

PROJECT BRIEF
The task is to analyse the provided data set to determine the success of the product launch for SocialBlaze's new app, Ribbon. SocialBlaze also have another app called InstantSnaps - Users accounts on InstantSnaps will be linked to Ribbon. The analysis will focus on key metrics and insights to present to the CEO and Founder.

INTRODUCTION
This analysis utilizes a dataset provided by SocialBlaze, encompassing significant information on Ribbon App operations spanning from its launch on July 4th to August 5th. The dataset contains 13 columns and 32 rows. it also contains a few information on their other app called "InstantSnaps". The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the application's performance, identify success factors and potential areas of improvement to capitalize on success or mitigate failure. The report will focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as engagement metrics, posts stats, growth rate etc.

KEY FINDINGS

1. USER ACQUISITION METRICS;
Since its launch, the Ribbon app has been installed by a staggering 3.4 billion people. However, approximately 3.85 million people failed to complete the sign up process. One plausible explanation for this high number of incomplete signups could be an overly complicated or uncompelling sign up process, leading users to become frustrated and abandon the app before completing the registration

2. RETENTION RATE;
A good retention rate for a social media app is about 27% - 43% within its first one month of the launch. It shows how well the app retains its active users within certain period. Ribbon retained a total of 2.64 billion active users since its launch.

NB: "RIBBON HAS A GOOD RETENTION RATE OF ABOUT 77% SINCE ITS LAUNCH. "

4. POST STATISTICS;
The app has a high number of posts made relatively compared to number of posts actually seen by users, suggesting significant content creation on the app but users might not be actively engaging with all of posts they see probably because of the app's algorithm. Within a month, a total of 65.3 million posts were made on Ribbon but users only saw about 25.4 million posts.
Over half of the posts made on the app go unnoticed by users, potentially leading to reduced engagement and revenue generation. This issue may arise from a poorly optimized algorithm that suppresses certain content and favors specific post types, or from the app's failure to deliver personalized and relevant content based on each user's preference.

NB: "HIGHER VISIBILITY LEADS TO INCREASED USER ENGAGEMENT AND PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO USER INTEREST. ABOUT 39% OF POSTS MADE ON RIBBON WERE ACTUALLY SEEN BY USERS. "

5. RIBBON USER ENGAGEMENT METRICS;
Time Spent on App

The app garners an average of about 5.3 hours of daily usage per user, demonstrating a considerable level of engagement and interest. This suggests that users highly value the app and derive amusement from it, as evidenced by their willingness to dedicate a significant amount of time to its usage. Merely observing the duration of users staying online does not provide comprehensive insights. it is essential to assess whether users actively engage with the app such as liking and reposing posts to obtain a clearer understanding of Ribbon's potential success.
There is a consistent growth in user engagement over the month. This upward trend indicates that users are actively interacting with the app's content and finding value in its features.

NB: "RIBBON APP'S CONTENT STRATEGY IS EFFECTIVELY DELIVERING ENGAGING AND RELEVANT CONTENT ON A REGULAR BASIS, CONTRIBUTING TO ITS POSITIVE GROWTH IN USER ENGAGEMENT.

6. APP STABILITY
The total amount of uninstalls and crash rate of the app can be used to measure the app's stability. Within a month, the app had about 872,291 uninstalls and about 1.5 million crashes. This means that there's a 6% chance the app will crash while in use, which can lead to negative reviews, loss of traffic on the app and loss of revenue.

NB: "RIBBON'S CRASH RATE IS RELATIVELY HIGHER THAN THE STANDARD 1% BENCHMARK.

7. INSTANTSNAPS USER ENGAGEMENT METRICS;
The analysis shows that InstantSnaps has more engagement compared to the Ribbon app. InstantSnaps has a total of about 4 trillion active users and about 2.6 trillion posts seen on the app. This shows that the users are actively engaging with the app.

CONCLUSION
Following a thorough analysis of the app's performance, my findings strongly suggests a promising future for Ribbon. The app's acquisition metrics, post statistics, app stability and user engagement have all displayed a positive trend, positioning Ribbon for continued success and growth in the ever changing social media world.

RECOMMENDATION
1. Ribbon should focus on optimizing the signup process, making it easy and user friendly inorder to improve user retention and reduce the issue of lesser signup compared to installations.
2. Ribbon's content suggestion algorithm requires optimization to deliver personalized and relevant content. This will address the problem of posts going unnoticed by users and lead to increased engagement.
3. For an enhanced user experience, Ribbon should integrate a feedback option in the app that allow users to provide explicit feedback on content suggestions, helping to fine tune the algorithm and improve personalization.
4. Ribbon app developers should always carryout regular testing on the app's crash analytics so as to effectively tackle the app's crash rate which is relatively higher than the standard benchmark.
5. Finally, since SocialBlaze would like to integrate user's InstanSnaps and Ribbon accounts, the team should enable followers to be carried over between apps. This seamless transition will offer content creators the chance to immediately interact and engage with their audience, leading to improved content performance and higher engagement metrics.
